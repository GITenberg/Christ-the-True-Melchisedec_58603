THE TRUE MELCHISEDEC.</h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<i>Now consider
how great this Man was</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;Heb. vii, 4.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sacred pages are an exhibition
of the loving heart of a covenant God, Father, Son, and Spirit;
from whence flow all the blessings of eternal life to guilty
man.&nbsp; All spring from love, for <i>God is love</i>&mdash;he
is love itself, the fountain of it.&nbsp; He loves himself, his
Son, and the eternal Spirit&mdash;it is a perfection of his
nature, boundless and incomprehensible.&nbsp; This eternal Three
in the One Jehovah, hath condescended of his sovereign goodwill
and pleasure, to love and chuse millions of men, though fallen
and depraved, guilty and hell-deserving&mdash;yet in a way of
mercy, pity, and compassion, determined to shew how far this love
could go&mdash;the Covenant of Redemption being made in eternity,
wherein the Father proposed to call his dear Son to engage in the
Work of Salvation&mdash;the Son as graciously accepting, offering
himself to be all, and do all in the great Work of Redemption, it
was purposed he should assume the nature of his people&mdash;for
this grand purpose, that he might represent <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>them, obey,
suffer, and die for them; for which he should be glorified in
that nature&mdash;see the travail of his soul, and be delighted
with all the happy consequences of his Work.&nbsp; This being
settled in infinite wisdom, our dear Lord anticipated the
pleasure of it before the world began&mdash;<i>My delights were
with the Sons of Men</i>.</p>
<p>On the sixth day of the creation he formed his creature, Man,
in the image in which he intended to appear four thousand years
after.&nbsp; His heart was so intent upon this great Work, that
directly after the Fall, yea, the very same day that Adam sinned,
the dear Redeemer hastened to make known the Covenant of
Redemption and Mercy&mdash;and even before he pronounced the
Curse in consequence of transgression, he pronounced the
Blessing!</p>
<p>Adam heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the
Garden&mdash;the WORD that was to be made flesh, that spoke for
us in the Covenant&mdash;he came, and foretold his future
incarnation&mdash;promised victory, and threatened Satan, who was
the instigation of the Fall.&nbsp; He frequently manifested his
gracious intention&mdash;proved himself to be the glorious
Mediator, and that he longed to become incarnate, to manifest his
grace by dying in our stead.&nbsp; In the act of cloathing our
guilty parents, he shewed himself the <i>end of the Law for
Righteousness</i>.&nbsp; In Abel&rsquo;s Person and Offering, he
shewed <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>himself the acceptable Sacrifice&mdash;the Lamb to take
away sin.&nbsp; In the Person of Noah, the Ark he built, the
Sacrifice he offered, the Covenant made with him in the Rainbow
(as the outward sign of it) were sweet tokens of him <i>who is
mighty to save</i>.&nbsp; The Blessing of Shem, clearly pointed
out his gracious intention&mdash;<i>God shall enlarge
Japheth</i>, <i>and HE</i> (<i>God</i>) <i>shall dwell in the
tents of Shem</i>.&nbsp; <i>The Word was made flesh</i>, <i>and
dwelt among us</i>.</p>
<p>He afterwards singles out Abram, the Father of the Faithful,
(of the line of Shem) called him out of darkness, favored him
with several glorious visions of himself, as predicting his
future incarnation, for <i>he saw his day and was glad</i>.&nbsp;
Abraham, under peculiar leadings of Providence, was for a season,
situated at Mamre, where he built an altar to the Lord.&nbsp;
This Mamre was in Kirath-Arba, afterwards called Hebron, where
David reigned for a season.&nbsp; But, alas, a christian is
seldom long at ease; we have no continuing city, we seek one to
come&mdash;no place, or house, or family, is free from trouble
long together, from the palace to the most retired cot.&nbsp; Sad
news was brought to Abraham, that his nephew, Lot, was taken
prisoner, and almost all his goods seized, by Cherdorlaomer and
his allies, who were at that time ravaging the country.&nbsp;
Abraham directly took his servants and friends and pursued the
enemy to Hobah, and overtook their captives and the booty, and of
course restored Lot.</p>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>When
Abraham was returning from routing Chedorlaomer and his allies,
Melchisedec met him in the valley of Shaveh, in the King&rsquo;s
Dale, and tendered to him and his weary troops, a refreshment of
bread and wine.&nbsp; He also blessed Abraham, and thanked God
for giving him the victory.&nbsp; Abraham acknowledged him the
Priest of the Most High God, and gave him the tenth part of the
spoil.&nbsp; Perhaps this was to shew God&rsquo;s approbation of
Abraham&rsquo;s conduct, and to point out the future victories of
our Lord Jesus Christ on the Cross, in the hearts of his people,
and, finally, over mystical Babylon, and its kings&mdash;the
recovery of his elect, who lay in the hands of Satan, Sin, and
Law; and of whom the Father had covenanted with his dear Son,
<i>that he should divide the spoil with the strong</i>, because
<i>he poured out his soul unto death</i>.&nbsp; While all who are
interested in this great Work must exclaim, <i>Unto him that
washed us from sin in his own blood</i>, <i>to him be
glory</i>.&nbsp; <i>Amen</i>.</p>
<p><i>Now consider how great this Man was</i>, to whom Abraham
gave the tenth of the spoil, and that blessed Abraham; and truly
the less is blessed of the greater.&nbsp; May God the Holy Spirit
assist us in our views of this great Man, the God-man Mediator,
the Priest, the King, the All in All.</p>
<p>We shall notice the opinion of others.&nbsp; We propose then
to examine the Scripture testimony of <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>this great One, and to answer the
objections which rise in the mind, concerning the reality of this
Person being <i>Lord</i> and <i>Christ</i>.&nbsp; We shall
finally notice the Nature of his Blessings.</p>
<p>I believe the general opinion of this great Man is, that he
was some King of Canaan, who was a good man, but whose genealogy
cannot be traced.&nbsp; The Jews and Samaritans will have him to
be Shem, their ancestor.&nbsp; The Arabians suppose him to be
Ham.&nbsp; Dr. Owen will have him to be a descendant of Japhet;
but how a descendant of Japhet came to be a king of Canaan, I
know not.&nbsp; Some are inclined to think he fell from the
Moon.&nbsp; But all these ideas are too mean, and none of them
agree with what the Holy Ghost has said of him.&nbsp; Many years
ago there was a Sect of Melchisedecian Heretics, who held that he
was some celestial power or virtue not revealed; but that he was
superior to Christ, and made intercession for angels, as the
Saviour did for Men.&nbsp; The most general opinion is that he
was merely a figure or type of our dear Lord; but we are about to
prove he was more than the figure&mdash;he was the adorable
Redeemer himself.&nbsp; We are not to make any thing in Scripture
a type when the Scripture declares it is a substance, and
infinitely exceeds all the figures.&nbsp; Our dear Lord is
certainly represented by many figures, but in the case before us
he is not; for the Apostle, treating upon the Subject, not
considering it as mystical <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>but real.&nbsp; He is not explaining a
mystery, but merely commenting upon a reality.&nbsp; <i>Now
consider how great this Man was</i>.&mdash;Perhaps no subject in
the Bible has had a greater diversity of opinions than this, and
the reason is, because Men are so dissatisfied with the
Spirit&rsquo;s testimony concerning him: let us therefore notice
the Apostle&rsquo;s own words, and follow him in his comment, and
there rest satisfied.&nbsp; This will lead us to answer a few
objections as we proceed.</p>
<p>The Apostle in this grand Epistle, is setting before the
believing Hebrews the Dignity, Majesty, and Glory of Christ, as
the Christ of God.&nbsp; He first proves him to be God over all,
equal with the Father in power and glory, in all his essential
attributes.&nbsp; He then shews <i>how far he excels the
angels</i>, they being the work of his hands, and he their great
Creator; and having accomplished the great Work of Atonement, he
has entered into his joy, and is now representing our Persons
before the throne; and as our great High Priest, still pleading
the virtue of what he has done, before the Father.&nbsp; In the
three following Chapters he shews the necessity there was that
Jesus, our great High Priest, should be tried by temptation, that
he might know how to succour the tempted&mdash;that his people,
by believing, might find a Sabbath of Rest in him, he encourages
them to hold fast their profession, seeing our great High Priest
is passed into <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>the heavens for them; and as he knew what sore
temptations meant, they might warranty apply to him for all that
grace they wanted in time of need.&nbsp; This is sweet
encouragement to the Lord&rsquo;s tried ones.</p>
<p>In the 5th Chapter, the Apostle carries on the subject of the
Priestly Office of Christ, knowing it to be of such vast
importance to the Church.&nbsp; He shews the commission of Jesus
to act as High Priest, and they, the Hebrews, well knew that no
man had a right to this Office but he that was called of God, as
was Aaron.&nbsp; So our dear Lord was called to it in the
Covenant, in which the Father glorified him, and as God-Man
Mediator, called him Son, and told him he should be a Priest for
ever, after a peculiar Order, that is, of Melchisedec: his own
Order, not of Levi or Aaron&rsquo;s, but his own divine
Order.&mdash;The Apostle then complains of these Believers, they
were dull of apprehension, or else he would tell them many more
very great things; but they had had the Gospel preached to them
nearly thirty years, yet had made little or no progress in the
things of God.&nbsp; He complains that they were but babes in
knowledge, unskilful, weak, and had got no further than the first
principles of the christian Religion, which he begs they will
leave, and press after greater lessons in the School of Christ,
namely, The final Perseverence of God&rsquo;s <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>elect, though
they might backslide, and even some of them go such sad lengths,
as even to give up their profession for a time, that nothing
short of the precious blood of Christ applied to their hearts by
the Spirit, could ever renew them to Gospel repentance.&nbsp;
Ministers could not&mdash;they could not do it
themselves&mdash;but a sight of Christ, put to open shame for
them, would ever accomplish it.</p>
<p>The Apostle proceeds to stimulate them to persevere in the
good ways of God, notwithstanding their weakness, sins,
infirmities, strange feelings, and at times, want of
confidence&mdash;no heart to pray or believe, but all deadness,
darkness, and sorrow; amidst all oppositions, yet to keep on,
encouraged by this, that a covenant God had provided every
needful mercy in Christ; that he has covenanted with him, and all
his seed in him, that they might have hope in his faithfulness,
and not in their own feelings or experience, which would waver,
or change.&nbsp; But for the further encouragement of that hope,
he would have them remember, that Christ is their Head and
Representative&mdash;that the Father&rsquo;s love is the same to
them as to him; that Christ and they are one; that they are
beheld in him complete; and that as their High Priest, he is
perfect&mdash;done a perfect Work; that he ever lives, and that
his great Work he is now doing in heaven, and will live to do for
ever, is simply, to bless his people, as he blessed their father,
Abraham, when he returned <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>from battle.&nbsp; And now, oh ye
believing Hebrews, <i>Consider how great this man was to whom
Abraham gave a tenth part of the spoil</i>.</p>
<p>Passing by the curious conjectures of men, let us attend to
the mind of the Spirit, and by close attention it will be clearly
seen that the Melchisedec which met Abraham was the adorable
Redeemer himself.&nbsp; We begin with the 6th verse of me 5th
Chapter&mdash;<i>As he saith also in another place</i>, <i>THOU
art a Priest for ever</i>, <i>after the Order of Melchisedec</i>,
<i>WHO in the days of HIS flesh</i>, <i>offered up strong cries
and tears to God</i>, <i>and was heard in that HE
feared&mdash;though HE were a SON</i>, <i>yet learned HE
obedience by the things which HE suffered</i>, <i>and being made
perfect</i>, <i>HE became the author of eternal salvation to all
that obey HIM</i>; <i>called of God an High Priest</i>, <i>after
the Order of Melchisedec</i>&mdash;<i>of whom we have many things
to say</i>, <i>and hard to be uttered</i>, <i>seeing ye are dull
of hearing</i>.&nbsp; Can any point be more clear than this; The
terms <i>Thou</i>, <i>Who</i>, <i>He</i>, <i>a Son</i>,
<i>Him</i>, in the <i>days of his flesh</i>&mdash;and surely if
Melchisedec had been a mere Man, Paul would not have complained
of the Hebrews being dull of understanding this Subject, of God
manifest in the flesh, before his incarnation, when he met
Abraham, and afterwards by actually taking our nature.</p>
<p>I would observe the connection between the <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>last verse of
the 6th Chapter, and the opening of the 7th.&nbsp; The Apostle,
encouraging Believers, who fled for refuge, tells them their
fore-runner is gone to heaven, and is acting there as High Priest
for them, after the Order of Melchisedec&mdash;it is essential to
this Order only to make intercession in heaven.&nbsp; From which
passage we may then conclude, that Melchisedec and the second
Person in the ever blessed Trinity were, and are the same; for
none but Christ in our nature ever did, or will intercede for us
in heaven.</p>
<p>The Apostle then goes on with this Subject in the 7th
Chapter.&nbsp; After declaring this Melchisedec is in heaven,
interceding according to his own peculiar Order, he adds, <i>For
THIS Melchisedec</i>, <i>King of Salem</i>, <i>Priest of the Most
High God</i>, <i>who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of
the kings</i>, <i>and blessed him&mdash;to whom also Abraham gave
a tenth part of all</i>.&nbsp; First, being, by interpretation,
<i>King of Salem</i>, which is, <i>King of Peace</i>&mdash;he
being <i>without Father</i>, <i>without Mother</i>, <i>having
neither beginning of days nor end of life</i>, <i>but made like
the Son of God</i>, <i>abideth a Priest
continually.&mdash;Consider now</i>, <i>how great this man
was</i>.&mdash;It is my grief, I cannot read the Greek for
myself; but upon good authority I have to remark, that the verb
Substantive not to be used here in any tense, but must be read
<i>Person</i>&mdash;and <i>is</i> instead of <i>was</i>&mdash;so
the text should be read, Now consider how great <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>this
<i>Person is</i>&mdash;the Person who continues a Priest for
ever, spoken of in the close of the 3rd verse, and which must be
read in the tense the Apostle speaks it.&nbsp; From which it
appears plain, that the Person who in the text met Abraham, is
now in heaven, interceding for his Church.&mdash;Abraham gave him
the tenth of the spoil, and therefore acknowledged him to be his
divine Priest and King.&nbsp; The Apostle then proceeds with the
Subject, and says, (5th verse) that this glorious Person, this
High Priest is not of the descent of Levi, not at all of that
tribe&mdash;as all Priests that belonged thereto were imperfect
and died, but this Melchisedec now receiveth tithes, because he
is our ever-living Priest.&nbsp; And at the close of the 8th
verse the Apostle says, It is witnessed of him that he liveth,
that is, that he is alive now&mdash;and in the 3rd verse says, he
abideth a Priest continually.&nbsp; This surely can never be said
of any mere man, of any typical character, of any Canaanitish
King, or any Priest, but our great Melchisedec.&nbsp; Some may
object that he may be said to live as many departed saints do,
but then it could not be said of him that <i>he continued to live
in his Office</i>, <i>as a Priest for ever</i>.</p>
<p>I think this Subject appears more clearly by the titles the
Holy Ghost gives him.&nbsp; The Apostle having asserted the
identity of the Person, goes on to prove the fact, by the name
Melchisedec, <i>King of Righteousness</i>.&nbsp; This title
belongs to Jesus only, <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>of whom it was prophesied, <i>Behold
a King shall reign in righteousness</i>, <i>and Princes shall
rule in judgment</i>.&nbsp; This was first accomplished upon the
ascension of our dear Lord, when he was exalted at the
Father&rsquo;s right-hand, and the decree went forth that all men
should bow to him.&nbsp; This shews him to be the righteousness
of his people, and that he fills Zion with it; and that one day
he will appear as the judge of quick and dead, and act before
assembled worlds, as a righteous Judge&mdash;<i>King of
Righteousness</i>.</p>
<p>The next title is <i>King of Peace</i>&mdash;as the author,
the preacher, and revealer of all Peace, external, internal, and
eternal.&nbsp; This title some have conjectured belonged to some
Canaanitish king who reigned in Salem, afterwards called
Jerusalem.&mdash;But the Apostle tells the Hebrews to regard the
meaning of the title, <i>King of Peace</i>&mdash;though the time
of his actual reigning in Jerusalem was not come, nor will it
till the latter day glory.&nbsp; At present he is King of Peace,
in the Gospel, in the Conscience, and in Mount
Zion.&mdash;<i>Without Father</i>.&mdash;The human nature he had
assumed at that time, in which he appeared to Abraham, was
without Father or Mother, without Descent; for as a Priest, the
Apostle is proving the fact, that he had no predecessors or
successors, so of course, unlike the tribe of Levi.&nbsp; As God,
he was without Father; the divine nature was underived, not
begotten.&nbsp; He <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>is the Son of God, in his official capacity, but not in
the divine essence.&nbsp; His human nature was without
Father&mdash;&ldquo;The Son of Man but no Man&rsquo;s Son,&rdquo;
<i>Erskine</i>.&mdash;<i>Without Mother</i>.&nbsp; The body, the
likeness, the form in which he appeared to Abraham, was without
Mother, for it was many years afterwards he was born of the
Virgin; and though she had the honour to bear him yet she was
purely passive is the act of the formation of his nature.&nbsp;
In these same senses he was <i>without Descent</i>&mdash;he had
no predecessors or successors, as God, or as the High Priest of
our Profession.&nbsp; Hence he is said to be the first and the
last; if so, then there were none before him, and there can be
none after him.&nbsp; The objection to this expression is, that
it only refers to a want of the knowledge of his Genealogy; but
though this might be the case of some persons, or of any, yet
they certainly descended from some one.&nbsp; It might as well be
argued that because I stand alone, and never heard of any one
relation in the world, that I was without descent.&nbsp; But then
the Apostle speaks in stronger terms still, and which can only be
applied to Divinity itself&mdash;<i>having neither beginning of
days</i>, <i>nor end of life</i>: this expression must refer to
his Divine Nature.&nbsp; He is himself the beginning, in whom God
made all things.&nbsp; In the beginning God created Heaven and
Earth; that is, in Christ; he was in the beginning with God, one
with him in the council and secret purposes of God; as well as
the everlasting God; nor <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>will he ever die as Man any
more.&nbsp; As Priest he never did die at all; as God, in his
Divine Nature, it is impossible.&nbsp; As the glorious Mediator,
he ever lives, and all who are united to him live
also.&mdash;</p>
<p><i>But made like the Son of God</i>.&nbsp; This expression,
<i>like</i>, seems dark to many at first sight, but when we look
at the Subject altogether, it is very clear that none can be like
God but God himself.&nbsp; None can be like such a Priest, after
such an Order, but the High Priest, Jesus himself.&nbsp; The body
he was to assume from the beginning, he frequently assumed a
likeness of.&nbsp; Hence Nebuchadnezzar saw one like the Son of
God in the Furnace.&nbsp; Now no christian can for a moment
disbelieve that this was Christ; and that, long before his
incarnation, the likeness that appeared was the likeness of his
body, now glorified.&nbsp; This appeared to Joshua, to Moses, to
Lot, to Abraham, Jacob, Ezekiel, and John.&mdash;These all saw
the likeness of the body that is now in heaven.&nbsp; So that
this Son of God appeared like the Son of God, after his
glorification.&nbsp; He loved our nature so well that he
anticipated the assumption of it; he rejoiced in the habitable
parts of the earth, and <i>his delights were with the Sons of
Men</i>.&nbsp; This the dear Redeemer shewed frequently, by his
visits to our earth, in the likeness of that body which is now
raised and glorified, and to which likeness the bodies of
God&rsquo;s elect are predestinated to be conformed.</p>
<p><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>I would
make the remark here, as we have answered the above objection, so
another is started, <i>How</i>, <i>and in what sense could this
Melchisedec receive tithes</i>?&nbsp; And, if a divine Person,
<i>What did he do with them</i>?&nbsp; On this I must confess
there is a difficulty.&nbsp; Paul says he <i>met</i>
Abraham&mdash;yet the word (as say the learned) means <i>being in
company together</i>.&nbsp; We shall now investigate this Subject
a little, and attend to its signification.</p>
<p>If this Melchisedec was only a Canaanitish King, I can see no
reason why Abraham should give him the tenth of the spoils he had
taken in battle; for I do not read of any king assisting in this
war, or even minding the stuff, or guarding the coast; for it
seems to have been a law among the warriors to divide the spoil,
as in the 1st of <i>Samuel</i>, 30th Chap.&nbsp; <i>But as his
part shall be that goeth to battle</i>, <i>so shall his be that
tarrieth by the stuff</i>, <i>they shall part alike</i>.&nbsp;
Now considering how great this Man was (or this Person <i>is</i>)
to whom Abraham gave the tenth, we are prone to ask those
questions that are of no importance to us, as, If this was
Christ, what use could they be to him&mdash;and what did he do
with them?&nbsp; We may as well ask, How the Lord and his
attendants eat, when Abraham made an entertainment at the tent
door&mdash;they appeared to him to eat.&nbsp; So, after his
resurrection from the dead they gave him a piece of broiled fish
<a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>and of an
honey comb, and he took it, and did eat before them.&nbsp; This
may lead us to ask still more curious questions, as, What body
was it in which our Lord made those appearances, and what became
of it?&nbsp; These things we must die to know; it is but of
little consequence to us now&mdash;what tithes Abraham gave him
he knew how to dispose of.&mdash;But in this instance the glory
of our Lord appears; for it is clear no man on earth was so great
as Abraham; so the Apostle argues, <i>and truly the less is
blessed of the greater</i>&mdash;Abraham, the less, was blessed
of Melchisedec, the greater.&nbsp; This was peculiar to his Order
only, nor does there want another Priest to arise after his
similitude, seeing he ever liveth to represent his people.</p>
<p>There was undoubtedly something of importance in this act of
Abraham&rsquo;s, and in which we may see, <i>First</i>,
Abraham&rsquo;s gratitude to the Captain of his Salvation, who
had given him success in this war, which was just and
necessary.&nbsp; So we find the Israelites devoted a part of the
spoils taken in battle, to the Lord, and the rest was divided
among them, (See <i>Numbers</i> xxxi, 25 v. to the
end).&mdash;When Jacob vowed to the Lord, he said, <i>Of all thou
shall give me I will surely give the tenth unto
thee</i>;&mdash;and hence in his posterity we find the tenth of
their portions were to be consecrated to the Lord, and this
tenth, so devoted, was a type of God&rsquo;s elect, Jews and
Gentiles, who were to be devoted <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>to his service.&nbsp; God, by the
Prophet <i>Isaiah</i>, Chap. vi, says, <i>But yet in it shall be
a tenth</i>, <i>and it shall return and shall be eaten</i>.&nbsp;
Abraham giving the tenth to Melchisedec, and keeping the rest,
(thus dividing the spoil) was an exhibition of what the Saviour
would do, actually, when he should divide the spoil with the
strong; when he should rise up early to the prey, and in the
evening of his death divide the spoil&mdash;give to God&rsquo;s
Law and Justice infinite satisfaction&mdash;to his people all the
blessings he secured, and get to himself a name above every
other, that at his name every knee should bow.&mdash;Thus he
divides the spoil, because he poured out his soul unto
death.&nbsp; So in the hearts of his elect, by the conquest of
his grace, when he spoils the works of the Devil in us, as well
as for us, and by Faith, leads us to get victory over every sin
and every fear, and enables us to give him the heart in a way of
love, the mind in his service, and all our powers devoted to his
glory, body, soul, and spirit, time and talents: this is giving
him the tenth.&nbsp; We have got the blessings he has enabled us
to get by Prayer and Faith, and we give him the glory due to his
holy name&mdash;while he oft refreshes us with himself as the
Bread of Life, fills us with the Wine of his love, and blesses us
with communion with himself&mdash;so we give him tithes of
all&mdash;hence the Apostle says, <i>that he now receiveth
them</i>.&mdash;<i>Thirdly</i>.&nbsp; This act may be a type of
that important <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>period when our glorious High Priest will receive his
elect at his second coming, when the faithful of whom Abraham was
a figure, will come from their graves, and meet Jesus&mdash;and
he will come from the third heaven and meet them, introduce them
into the heavenly country, the new heaven and earth.&nbsp; Here
our Priest will bless us, and here we shall cast our crowns at
his dear feet, and sing&mdash;Worthy the Lamb that was
slain.&nbsp; Thus we shall give him tithes of all.</p>
<p>The Dignity and Identity of this glorious Person may be
clearly seen by the nature of his Priestly Office&mdash;this is
what the Apostle is proving by a quotation from the 110th
<i>Psalm</i>&mdash;<i>Thou art a Priest for ever</i>, <i>after
the Order of Melchisedec</i>.&nbsp; How mean is the common idea
that he was a Canaanitish king, and that Christ is a Priest after
his order.&nbsp; Had Christ been constituted a Priest after any
Order of human Beings, it would have been after the Order of
Aaron, a Priest of God&rsquo;s own appointment; but Christ is a
Priest after his own Order.&nbsp; When God means to swear he
swears by himself, because there is no greater&mdash;when he
means to draw a similitude of himself he likens himself to
himself; and when Jesus reveals himself as a Priest after an
Order, it is his own Order, and his glory will he not give to
another.</p>
<p>The Apostle in this Epistle, is setting forth the <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>Divinity and
Glory of Jesus, as God-Man Mediator; and shews how far he excels
angels, and then how far he excelled Moses.&nbsp; He then points
out how far he excelled Aaron; and in his Office of High Priest,
how far he excelled all the Priests of the Levitical
Order&mdash;they were mere men, he the God-Man&mdash;they were
mortal and died, he was immortal, and ever lived.&nbsp; The fact
is, that the Son of God having finished the great Work of
Redemption, sat down on the right-hand of God, agreeably to what
is said in the 110th <i>Psalm</i>&mdash;<i>The Lord said to my
Lord</i>, <i>sit at my right-hand</i>, <i>for THOU art a Priest
for ever</i>.&nbsp; This makes it evident that the Priests under
the Old Testament Dispensation typified Jesus, as exercising his
Priestly Office before his ascension; but the Order of our
Melchisedec is appearing in a glorified state, at the right-hand
of the Majesty in heaven, representing and blessing his
people.&nbsp; This is the Order the Father appointed him, and in
this he continues.&nbsp; This he revealed to Abraham, and in the
act of blessing him shewed what he was to be and do, upon his
glorification, after his battle was over, of which
Abraham&rsquo;s war was but a faint shadow.&nbsp; That
Melchisedec is the Son of God appears evident from his call to
the Priesthood.&nbsp; So the Apostle has coupled these two texts
together in the 5th Chapter&mdash;<i>Thou art my Son</i>, <i>this
day have I begotten thee</i>.&nbsp; <i>As he saith</i>,
<i>also</i>, <i>in another place</i>.&nbsp; <i>Thou art a Priest
for ever</i>, <i>after the Order of Melchisedec</i>.&nbsp; From
which we <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>must infer that Melchisedec is the eternal Son of
God&mdash;for God declaring Christ to be his Son, was at the same
time constituting him a Priest for ever, after his own Order, as
King of Righteousness and Peace, fulfilling the one, and making
the other for his Church.&nbsp; Upon his ascension he was to
abide a Priest and King for ever&mdash;the eternity of his
Priesthood clearly demonstrates the fact&mdash;the term <i>for
ever</i>&mdash;a Priest <i>for ever</i>.&nbsp; This was essential
to his Order, eternal Priesthood, therefore he must be eternal,
which could never be said of any mere man&mdash;of course the
Son, or second Person, is the Melchisedec that met Abraham, that
now <i>liveth</i> and <i>abideth</i>.&nbsp; The Apostle also
declares that his Order is Perfection, and the Power of an
endless Life, in opposition to the Levitical Priesthood, which
was imperfect, and they carnal men.&mdash;The Father&rsquo;s
language to the Son in the 110th <i>Psalm</i>, according to the
learned <i>Morrison&rsquo;s Scripture Dictionary</i>, is rendered
literally in the original, <i>Jehovah hath sworn</i>, <i>and will
not repent</i>, <i>Thou art a Priest for ever</i>, <i>upon or
according to my Word</i>, <i>O MELCHISEDEC</i>.&nbsp; This is
addressed from the Father to the Son, and to no other
Person.&nbsp; On this verse, the good Dr. <i>Hawker</i> remarks,
that the Psalmist is tracing up the Subject to the everlasting
Council of Peace between them both, in Jehovah swearing-in Christ
into his Priestly Office, even that of an everlasting
Priesthood.&nbsp; These things cannot be said of any mere man;
nor does it any where assert <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>that Melchisedec was a type&mdash;but
the above arguments clearly prove he was the eternal Son of God;
and to doubt this, or be ignorant of it, the Apostle declares the
Hebrews were dull of hearing; and surely so are many of
God&rsquo;s people, to this day, upon this
Subject&mdash;therefore, <i>Consider now how great this Person
is</i>&mdash;he is called the great God, the great Saviour, great
King, great Prince, great Shepherd, great High Priest; great in
his nature, his love, his mercy, his wisdom, his glory, his
grace, his power; and these he delights to shew to his dear
people, who are called upon to consider him&mdash;these are said
to fly for refuge to him, to cast anchor within the veil, either
of his flesh, and lay hold of his eternal Divinity, or into
ultimate glory, and view Jesus as an ever-living Priest, carrying
on their cause, representing their Persons, pleading the virtue
of his blood and righteousness, and abideing till all his foes
become his footstool, and the mystery of God shall be finished;
then the Son will deliver up the mediatorial kingdom to the
Father, and God, Father, Son, and Spirit shall be all in all.</p>
<p>The last consideration is, <i>The Work he carries on as a
Priest</i>, <i>under this peculiar Order</i>.&nbsp; The Priest
under the old Law, no doubt, typified him; but perhaps very
little further as types than his death, or entering into the Holy
of Holies.&nbsp; Here they as types fail, and we see Jesus of
another Order, and under a different view, upon his
glorification, <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>carry on his Priestly Office in heaven.&nbsp; Aaron the
High Priest, in many things typified him, tho&rsquo; Christ was
not of that Order, but of the tribe of Judah, of which Moses
spake nothing pertaining to the Priesthood.&nbsp; But our dear
Lord is become the author of eternal salvation to his people, and
still officiates as an High Priest after his own Order&mdash;and
this Order is not to make an atonement, or fulfil the Law, this
he had done; but exalted to <i>bless</i> his people for
ever.&mdash;This Office was shewed to Abraham when Christ met
him, and refreshed him with bread and wine, a figure of his body
and blood, which were to be offered up in sacrifice, and upon
that offering his intercession was founded, and all blessings are
dispensed by him, as it followed, and he blessed Abraham.&nbsp;
Hence, having purged our sins, he has sat down at his
Father&rsquo;s right-hand to bless us for evermore.&nbsp; This is
peculiar to his Order only, for this he ever lives.&nbsp; Perhaps
every blessing he communicates as a Priest, is included in that
prescribed form the Priests used under the old Law,
<i>Numbers</i> 6th Chap, verse 22, to the close.</p>
<p>He met, and blessed Abraham with Righteousness and Peace; and
to this day he gives the same to us, for as many as are of Faith
are blessed with faithful Abraham.&nbsp; Hence the benediction,
the Lord give thee Peace.&nbsp; And the Apostle says, He is
exalted to give Repentance and Remission of Sins&mdash;<i>thy
sins are forgiven thee</i>; <i>go in peace</i>.&nbsp; He <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>blesses us
with converting grace.&nbsp; God hath sent his Son to bless us,
by turning us from our iniquities, with a better
righteousness.&nbsp; David describeth the blessedness of the man
to whom the Lord imputeth righteousness without works, with the
adoption of children&mdash;to them gave he power to become the
Sons of God&mdash;with spiritual life.&nbsp; The Lord commanded
his blessing on Mount Zion, even life for evermore.&nbsp; He
blesses them with his preserving power; his guiding Spirit in all
his Offices; the light of his countenance; a new nature and a new
name&mdash;these are all included in his Priestly Benediction,
which the Priests could only pronounce, and we can only pray for,
but which it is his glory to give, as our
Melchisedec&mdash;<i>the Lord bless thee and keep
thee</i>&mdash;<i>the Lord make his face to shine upon thee</i>,
<i>and be gracious unto thee&mdash;the Lord lift up his
countenance upon thee</i>, <i>and give thee peace</i>.&nbsp;
<i>And they shall put my name upon the Children of Israel</i>,
<i>and I will bless them</i>.&nbsp; This act of the
Redeemer&rsquo;s intercession and blessing, is in an
authoritative way&mdash;<i>Father I will that those whom thou
hast given me</i>, <i>be with me where I am</i>, <i>that they may
behold my glory</i>&mdash;which God grant us all.&mdash;AMEN.</p>

<div class="gapshortdoubleline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>Thus we
have endeavoured to prove that Christ is the true Melchisedec,
without a type or figure&mdash;that he was not Shem, nor his
Grandson, nor an earthly King, however pious; but that it was
Jesus appearing in the likeness in which he should appear for
ever, before the throne, to bless his people in.&nbsp; This fact
we have attempted to prove from express passages, from his
glorious titles, from the peculiarity of his Order, and the
nature of his Work, as a Priest.</p>
<p>For a most judicious handling of this Subject I refer my
Readers to <span class="smcap">Morrison&rsquo;s Bibliotheca
Sacra</span>&mdash;to which I am much indebted.</p>
<h2>AN HYMN.</h2>
<blockquote><p>KING of Salem, bless my soul!<br />
Make a wounded sinner whole!<br />
King of righteousness and peace,<br />
Let not thy sweet visits cease.</p>
<p>Come, refresh this soul of mine<br />
With thy sacred bread and wine;<br />
All thy love to me unfold,<br />
Half of which cannot be told.</p>
<p>Hail, Melchisedec divine!<br />
Thou great High Priest shalt be mine;<br />
All my powers before thee fall&mdash;<br />
Take not tythe, but take them all.</p>

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
